Basically a Unicode keyboard, have fun figuring it out

Excellent for :
- Non stop yappers
- That friend that responds too quickly
- You bored
- The guy proud of learning a new language that he will never use

Use Android Studio, generate apk then install

Some comments may be in french, too lazy to translate 

Parts of the new code are ai generated by Microslop's ai, placing the user in the middle of an unmatched experience

Also, it is not a real unicode as it uses StringEscapeUtils and if you enter a wrong character it crashes

Have fun, from MaKr0Hard


Also there might be some problems on Android 16
